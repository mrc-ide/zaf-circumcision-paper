\section{Statistical Methods}
\label{sec::methods}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Using a Bayesian hierarchical model with small area estimation methods, we modelled probabilities of circumcision stratified by region, age, and time for two types of circumcision: (1) circumcisions that occurred in traditional male initiation ceremonies or for other religious or cultural reasons (TMIC) and (2) circumcisions for non-traditional reasons and/or HIV prevention that take place in a clinical setting using medical methods (MMC-nT). Reflecting recent efforts to encourage adoption of medical methods in TMICs, TMICs were sub-categorised into: (1) traditional circumcisions conducted using non-medical methods (TMC) and (2) circumcisions conducted as part of TMIC but using medical methods (MMC-T), determined by a district- and year-specific probability that TMIC circumcisions were performed as MMC-Ts.\\

\noindent Probabilities of circumcision were estimated using a competing risk discrete time-to-event model \cite{putter2006tutorial}, with estimates of circumcision coverage by type within each cohort calculated using the cumulative incidence. These were combined with data on male population size to calculate the predicted number of circumcisions conducted per year. Likelihood functions were specified for the two data sources to inform parameter calibration: (1) the probability of individual-level observations of circumcision age, type, and year reported by men in national household surveys in a time-to-event framework, and (2) the reported number of medical male circumcisions conducted in each district for HIV prevention among males 10 years and older using a Poisson count model. \\

\noindent Throughout the methods and applications sections, we refer to the following types of circumcision (Figure \ref{fig::modelstr}):
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{MMC-nT:} Medical male circumcisions conducted outside of traditional male initiation ceremonies, representing the large majority of MMC conducted.
    \item \textbf{TMC:} Traditional male circumcisions, assumed to be conducted outside a medical setting for traditional male initiation purposes.
    \item \textbf{MMC-T:} Medical male circumcisions conducted as part of traditional male initiation ceremonies, typically in place of circumcisions that previously would have been conducted as TMC.
\end{itemize}
Useful aggregates of these circumcision types are referred to as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{MMC:} All medical male circumcisions (MMC-nT + MMC-T), assumed to be consistent with circumcisions reported through VMMC programme data reporting.
    \item \textbf{TMIC:} All male circumcisions conducted as part of traditional male initiation practices (TMC + MMC-T).
    \item \textbf{MC:} All male circumcisions of any type (MMC-nT + TMC + MMC-T).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Process model}
\label{sec::competingrisks}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Probabilities of circumcision per time step}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Utilising data from household surveys, we modelled the probabilities of becoming circumcised per time step through either TMIC or MMC-nT for individuals residing in region $i \in I = \{1, 2, \ldots, N_I\}$ having an MMC, MMC-nT, MMC-T, TMC, TMIC or MMC at age $a \in A = \{0, 1, 2, \ldots, N_A\}$ and time $t \in T = \{1, 2, \ldots, N_T\}$. \\

\noindent We defined $\lambda^{\text{TMIC}}_{iat}$ as the probability that an individual in region $i$ received TMIC at age $a$ and time step $t$, given they were uncircumcised by age $a-1$ and time $t-1$, 
\begin{equation} 
		\lambda^{\text{TMIC}}_{iat} = \mathbb{P}(\text{TMIC} \; \text{in} \; (i,a,t) \; | \; \text{Uncircumcised in} \; (i,a-1, t-1)). 
	\label{eqn::tmic}
\end{equation}
This was modelled using piece-wise logit-linear function:
\begin{equation*} 
	\text{logit}(\lambda^{\text{TMIC}}_{iat}) = \hat{\alpha} + \hat{\psi_i} + \hat{\phi}_a + \hat{\gamma}_{ia}
\end{equation*}
where $\hat{\alpha}$ is the intercept, $\hat{\psi_i}$ is a regional random effect, $\hat{\phi}_a$ is an age random effect, and $\hat{\gamma}_{ia}$ is an age-space interaction term to allow different age patterns of TMIC  across regions. We assumed that the probability of TMIC was constant over time (i.e. $\lambda^{\text{TMIC}}_{iat} \equiv \lambda^{\text{TMIC}}_{ia}$) as TMIC practices have been relatively stable over time. \\

\noindent Similarly, we defined $\lambda^{\text{MMC-nT}}_{iat}$ as the probability an individual in region $i$ received MMC-nT at age $a$ and time $t$, $\lambda^{\text{MMC-T}}_{iat}$, given they were uncircumcised by age $a-1$ and time $t-1$,  
\begin{equation}
		\lambda^{\text{MMC-nT}}_{iat} = \mathbb{P}(\text{MMC-nT} \; \text{in} \; (i,a,t) \; | \; \text{Uncircumcised in} \; (i,a-1, t-1)),
	\label{eqn::mmc}
\end{equation}
To ensure the overall probability of circumcision $\lambda^{\text{TMIC}}_{iat} + \lambda^{\text{MMC-nT}}_{iat} \leq 1$ for all $i$, $a$ and $t$ in the discrete-time framework, we applied the probability of TMIC  before MMC-nT in each time step, and therefore initially model the probability an individual in region $i$ received MMC-nT at age $a$ and time $t$, $\lambda^{\text{MMC-T}}_{iat}$, given they were uncircumcised by age $a-1$ and time $t-1$ and did not recieve TMIC at age $a$ and time $t$
\begin{equation*}
		\tilde{\lambda}^{\text{MMC-nT}}_{iat} = \mathbb{P}(\text{MMC-nT} \; \text{in} \; (i,a,t) \; | \; \text{Uncircumcised in} \; (i,a-1, t-1) \text{ and no TMIC in} \; (i,a, t))
\end{equation*}
such that
\begin{equation*}
		\lambda^{\text{MMC-nT}}_{iat} = \tilde{\lambda}^{\text{MMC-nT}}_{iat}\cdot (1-\lambda^{\text{TMIC}}_{iat}).
\end{equation*}
The probability $\tilde{\lambda}^{\text{MMC-nT}}_{iat}$ was separated into two processes: (i) paediatric circumcision (for those aged 0--9) and (ii) adolescent and adult circumcision (for those aged 10 and over). VMMC programmes only provide MMCs for HIV prevention to those aged 10 and over, while infant and paediatric medical circumcision tends to occur through cultural or religious practices unrelated to scale-up of VMMC for HIV prevention. Therefore, we modelled $\tilde{\lambda}^{\text{MMC-nT}}_{iat}$ using a piece-wise logit-linear function:
\begin{equation*}
	\text{logit}(\tilde{\lambda}^{\text{MMC-nT}}_{iat}) =
	\begin{cases}
		\bar{\alpha} + \bar{\psi}_i + \bar{\phi}_a + \bar{\gamma}_{ia} & \text{for } 0 \leq a \leq 9\\
		\alpha + \psi_i + \phi_a + \theta_t + \gamma_{ia} + \delta_{at} + \zeta_{it} & \text{for } a \geq 10
	\end{cases} 
\end{equation*}
where $\bar{\alpha}$ and $\alpha$ are intercepts, $\bar{\psi}_i$ and $\psi_i$ are regional random effects, $\theta_i$ are temporal random effects, $\bar{\phi}_a$ and $\phi_a$ are age random effects, $\bar{\gamma}_{ia}$ and $\gamma_{ia}$ are age-space interaction terms to allow for different age patterns of MMC-nTs between regions, for paediatric circumcision and adolescent and adult circumcision respectively. The $\delta_{at}$ is an age-time interaction term to allow for different age patterns of MMC-nTs over time and $\zeta_{it}$ is an space-time interaction term to allow for different uptake of MMC-nTs over time across regions, in adolescent and adult men. Similarly, we assumed that the probabilities of MMC-nT among those aged 0--9 were constant over time, (i.e. $\lambda^{\text{MMC-nT}}_{iat} \equiv \lambda^{\text{MMC-nT}}_{ia}$ when $0\leq a \leq 9$), as paediatric medical circumcision practices are unrelated to VMMC for HIV prevention and are relatively stable. \\

\noindent For individuals circumcised in TMIC, we defined a probability, $p_{iat}$ that circumcision was conducted as a MMC-T versus TMC, specified for region $i$, age $a$, and time $t$. The probability an individual in region $i$ received MMC-T at age $a$ and time $t$, $\lambda^{\text{MMC-T}}_{iat}$ was thus 
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		\lambda^{\text{MMC-T}}_{iat} &= \mathbb{P}(\text{MMC-T} \; \text{in} \; (i,a,t) \; | \; \text{Uncircumcised in} \; (i,a-1, t-1)) \\
		&=p_{iat}\cdot\lambda^{\text{TMIC}}_{iat}
	\end{split}
	\label{eqn::mmct}
\end{equation}
and  the probability an individual in region $i$ received TMIC was
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		\lambda^{\text{TMC}}_{iat} &= \mathbb{P}(\text{TMC} \; \text{in} \; (i,a,t) \; | \; \text{Uncircumcised in} \; (i,a-1, t-1)) \\
		&=(1-p_{iat})\cdot\lambda^{\text{TMIC}}_{iat}
	\end{split}
	\label{eqn::tmc}
\end{equation}
Prior to VMMC programmes, all circumcisions conducted in TMIC were TMC, in which case $p_{iat}=0$. The proportion of TMICs conducted as MMC-Ts may not be identifiable from the survey data, particularly for years since the most recent survey. Thus $p_{iat}>0$ should only be introduced in regions where there is knowledge that MMC-Ts were implemented in TMIC settings. \\

\noindent Taken together, the probability of circumcision of any type, at age $a$ and time $t$ given they were uncircumcised by age $a-1$ and time $t-1$ was 
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
	\lambda^{\text{MC}}_{iat} &= \mathbb{P}(\text{MC} \; \text{in} \; (i,a,t) \; | \; \text{Uncircumcised in} \; (i,a-1,t-1)) \\
	              &= \lambda^{\text{TMC}}_{iat} + \lambda^{\text{MMC-T}}_{iat} + \lambda^{\text{MMC-nT}}_{iat} \\ 
	              &= \lambda^{\text{TMIC}}_{ia} + \lambda^{\text{MMC-nT}}_{iat}. 
	\end{split}
	\label{eqn::tot}
\end{equation}
The probability an individual in region $i$ remained uncircumcised at age $a$ and time $t$, given they were uncircumcised by age $a-1$ and time $t-1$, was
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		\lambda^{\text{UC}}_{iat} &= \mathbb{P}(\text{Uncircumcised in}  \; (i,a,t) \; | \; \text{Uncircumcised in} \; (i,a-1, t-1)),\\
		&= 1 - \lambda^{\text{TMIC}}_{iat} - \lambda^{\text{MMC-nT}}_{iat} \\
		&= (1 - \lambda^{\text{TMIC}}_{iat})(1 - \tilde{\lambda}^{\text{MMC-nT}}_{iat})
	\end{split}
	\label{eqn::uncirc}
\end{equation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Cumulative incidence of circumcision}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The probability $S_{iat}$ of remaining uncircumcised up to age $a$ and time $t$,  typically referred to as the survivor function, was expressed as
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		S_{iat} &= \mathbb{P}(\text{Uncircumcised in} \; (i,a-1,t-1)) \\
				&= \prod_{(0,(t-a))}^{(a-1,t-1)}\lambda^{\text{UC}}_{iat} \\
				&= \lambda^{\text{UC}}_{i,0,t-a}\cdot \lambda^{\text{UC}}_{i,1,t-a+1}\cdot\ldots \cdot\lambda^{\text{UC}}_{i,a-1,t-1}
	\end{split}
	\label{eqn::survfunc}
\end{equation}
The cumulative incidence function (CIF) defines the marginal probability (or proportion/coverage of) individuals who were circumcised by type $k\in K = \{$ MMC, MMC-nT, MMC-T, TMC, TMIC or MMC$\}$ by age $a$ and time $t$, accounting for the competing risk of other circumcision type. This was calculated as the sum of incidence of circumcision by type $k$ at each age up to $a$:
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		\text{CIF}_{iat}^k &= \mathbb{P}(k \; \text{by} \; (i,a,t)) \\
		&= \sum_{(0,(t-a))}^{(a,t)} I^k_{iat}
	\end{split}
	\label{eqn::cuminc}
\end{equation}
where $I^k_{iat}$ is the incidence of circumcision type $k$ in region $i$, age $a$ and time $t$. For types $k \in \{\textrm{TMIC}, \textrm{TMC}, \textrm{MMC-T}\}$, this was defined by the probability of remaining uncircumcised by any type up to age $a$ at time $t$ times the probability of circumcision by type $k$ in year $t$ at age $a$
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		I_{iat}^k &= \mathbb{P}(k \; \text{in} \; (i,a,t)) \\
		       &= \mathbb{P}(k \; \text{in} \; (i,a,t) | \; \text{Uncircumcised in} \; (i,a-1,t-1))\times \\
		       & \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\mathbb{P}(\text{Uncircumcised in} \; (i,a-1,t-1)) \\
	    	   &= \lambda_{iat}^k \cdot S_{iat} 
	\end{split}
	\label{eqn::inc}
\end{equation}
The overall incidence and CIF by any circumcision type can be obtained by summing across all circumcision types. The CIF is also often referred to as the `sub-distribution function', due to the fact that the cumulative probability of a particular event $k$ by time $t$ will remain below one \cite{putter2006tutorial}. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Programme data model}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Utilising data on the number of VMMCs reported, we further informed the probabilities of becoming circumcised by region, age and time step. VMMCs conducted by public health programmes consisted of the total number of MMCs (both MMC-nT and MMC-T) conducted in region $i$ at time $t$ and age group $G=[a_1,a_2]$, $Y_{iGt}$. We modelled number of MMCs, $Y^{\text{MMC-nT}}_{iat}$, and MMC-Ts, $Y^{\text{MMC-T}}_{iat}$ in region $i$, at age $a$ and time $t$ using a Poisson likelihood with means $\mu^{\text{MMC}}_{iat}$ and $\mu^{\text{MMC-T}}_{iat}$ respectively,
\begin{equation*}
    Y^{k}_{iat} \;|\; \mu^{k}_{iat}\sim \text{Poisson}(\mu^{k}_{iat}) \\
	\label{eqn::VMMCPoisson}
\end{equation*}
where $k$ is MMC-T or MMC-nT. The mean $\mu^{k}_{iat}$ is determined by multiplying the male population size in region $i$, at age $a$ and time $t$, $P_{iat}$, the probability of remaining uncircumcised in region $i$, up to age $a$ and time $t$, $S_{iat}$, and the probability of being having a MMC-T or MMC-nT at age $a$ and time $t$ given they were uncircumcised by age $a-1$ and time $t-1$, $\lambda^{\text{MMC-T}}_{iat}$ or $\lambda^{\text{MMC-T}}_{iat}$
\begin{equation*}
    \mu^k_{iat} = P_{iat}\cdot S_{iat} \cdot \lambda^{k}_{iat}.
\end{equation*}
where $k$ is MMC-T or MMC-nT. 
\noindent It then follows that the total number of MMCs conducted in region $i$ at time $t$ and age group $G=[a_1,a_2]$, $Y_{iGt}$ are modelled using 
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
		Y_{iGt} \;|\; \mu_{iat} &\sim \text{Poisson}(\mu_{iGt}) \\
		\mu_{iGt} &= \sum_{a = a_1}^{a_2} \mu^{\text{MMC-nT}}_{iat} + \mu^{\text{MMC-T}}_{iat}.
	\end{split}
\end{equation*}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Priors}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In space, we assigned the random effects $\hat{\psi}_i$, $\bar{\psi}_i$, $\psi_i$, $\hat{\gamma}_{ia}$, $\gamma_{ia}$ and $\zeta_{it}$, intrinsic conditional autoregressive (ICAR) priors \cite{besag1995conditional}. An ICAR model encodes spatial dependence between neighbours, defined as areas that share a common boundary, and allows information to be borrowed across regions, which may be useful in areas where data is sparse or non-existent. For a generic parameter $\beta_i$, an ICAR model assumes that the expected value of $\beta_i$ is a weighted average its neighbours, 
\begin{equation*}
	\beta_i \;|\; \beta_{j}, j \sim i, \tau_{\beta} \sim \text{N}\left(\frac{1}{n_i} \sum_{j \sim i} \beta_j, \frac{1}{n_i\tau_{\beta}} \right) \;\;\; i = 1, 2, 3,\ldots, N_I
\end{equation*}
where $j \sim i$ refers to the neighbours of region $i$, $n_i$ is the number of neighbours and $\tau_{\beta}$ is the marginal precision. The joint distribution may be equivalently expressed as $\boldsymbol{\beta} \sim N(\boldsymbol{0}, \tau_{\beta}^{-1}Q^{-1}_{I})$ where $Q_{I}$ is the precision matrix encoding the adjacency structure of the neighbourhoods. The precision matrix $Q_{I}$ is rank deficient and consequently the prior is improper \cite{rue2005gaussian}. \\

\noindent In time, we assigned the random effects $\theta_t$, $\delta_{at}$ and $\zeta_{it}$ an autoregressive process of order 1 (AR1) priors,
\begin{align*} 
  \beta_t \; | \; \rho_{\beta}, \tau_{\beta} &\sim
  \begin{cases}
  	N(0, \tau^{-1}_{\phi}) & a = 0\\
  	N(\rho_{\beta} \cdot \beta_{t-1}, \;\; \tau^{-1}_{\beta}) \;\;\; & t = 1, 2,\ldots, N_A
  \end{cases}
\end{align*}
where $|\rho_{\phi}| < 1$ is an autocorrelation parameters controlling the correlation of the effect of the current age on the previous age and $\tau_{\beta}$ is the precision. The joint distribution may be equivalently expressed as $\boldsymbol{\beta}\; | \; \rho_{\beta}, \tau_{\beta} \sim N(\boldsymbol{0}, \tau_{\beta}^{-1}Q^{-1}_{T}(\rho_{\beta}))$ where $Q_{T}$ is the precision matrix and encodes the first order dependency in time controlled by the autocorrelation parameter $\rho_{\beta}$.\\

\noindent In age, we modelled the random effects $\hat{\phi}_a$, $\bar{\phi}_a$, $\phi_a$, $\hat{\gamma}_{ia}$, $\bar{\gamma}_{ia}$, $\gamma_{ia}$ and $\delta_{at}$ using penalised B-spline functions of the form,
\begin{align*} 
	\beta_a = \sum_{j = 1}^{N_J} \omega_{j}f_{aj}
\end{align*} 
where $f_{aj}$ are B-spline basis functions with knots every five years, $N_J$ is the number of splines used and $\omega_{a}$ are the spline weight parameters to be estimated. The weights $\omega_{a}$ are penalised using an AR1 process (as above) and the joint distribution is given by $\boldsymbol{\omega}\; | \; \rho_{\omega}, \tau_{\omega} \sim N(\boldsymbol{0}, \tau_{\omega}^{-1}Q^{-1}_{A}(\rho_{\omega}))$ where $Q_{A}$ is the precision matrix as defined by the smoothed function. Then defining $\boldsymbol{\beta} = W_{\beta}\cdot \boldsymbol{\omega}$ where $W_{\beta}$ is a design matrix evaluating the basis functions $f_{aj}$ at each age of interest, the joint distribution of $\boldsymbol{\beta}\; | \;\boldsymbol{\omega}, \; W_{\beta}, \; \rho_{\omega}, \tau_{\omega}$ is given by, $\boldsymbol{\beta}\; | \;\boldsymbol{\omega}, \; W_{\beta}, \; \rho_{\omega}, \tau_{\omega} \sim N(\boldsymbol{0}, \tau_{\omega}^{-1}(W_{\beta}\cdot Q^{-1}_{A}(\rho_{\omega})\cdot W_{\beta}^T))$.\\

\noindent Moreover, the age-space, age-time, and space-time interaction terms ($\hat{\gamma}_{ia}$, $\bar{\gamma}_{ia}$, $\gamma_{ia}$, $\delta_{at}$ and $\zeta_{it}$) are modelled as Type IV interactions as defined by Knorr-Held and Leonard \cite{knorr2000bayesian},
\begin{align*} 
  \hat{\boldsymbol{\gamma}} \; | \; \rho_{\boldsymbol{\hat{\gamma}}}, \tau_{\boldsymbol{\hat{\gamma}}} &\sim N(\boldsymbol{0}, \;\tau^{-1}_{\hat{\gamma}} Q^{-1}_{\hat{\gamma}}) \\
  \bar{\boldsymbol{\gamma}} \; | \; \rho_{\boldsymbol{\bar{\gamma}}}, \tau_{\boldsymbol{\bar{\gamma}}} &\sim N(\boldsymbol{0}, \;\tau^{-1}_{\bar{\gamma}} Q^{-1}_{\bar{\gamma}}) \\
  \boldsymbol{\gamma} \; | \; \rho_{\gamma}, \tau_{\gamma} &\sim N(\boldsymbol{0}, \;\tau^{-1}_{\gamma} Q^{-1}_{\gamma})\\
  \boldsymbol{\delta} \; | \; \rho_{1\delta}, \rho_{2\delta}, \tau_{\delta} &\sim N(\boldsymbol{0}, \;\tau^{-1}_{\delta} Q^{-1}_{\delta})\\
  \boldsymbol{\zeta} \; | \; \rho_{\zeta}, \tau_{\zeta} &\sim N(\boldsymbol{0}, \;\tau^{-1}_{\zeta} Q^{-1}_{\zeta})
\end{align*}
where the precision matrices constructed using Kronecker products 
\begin{align*} 
	Q_{\hat{\gamma}} &= [W_{\hat{\gamma}}\cdot Q_A(\rho_{\hat{\gamma}}) \cdot W^T_{\hat{\gamma}} ]\otimes Q_I\\
	Q_{\bar{\gamma}} &= [W_{\bar{\gamma}}\cdot Q_A(\rho_{\bar{\gamma}}) \cdot W^T_{\bar{\gamma}} ]\otimes Q_I\\
	Q_{\gamma} &= [W_{\gamma}\cdot Q_A(\rho_{\gamma}) \cdot W^T_{\gamma} ]\otimes Q_I\\
	Q_{\delta} &=[W_{\delta}\cdot Q_A(\rho_{1\delta}) \cdot W^T_{\delta} ] \otimes Q_T(\rho_{2\delta})\\
	Q_{\zeta} &=Q_I \otimes Q_T(\rho_{\zeta})
\end{align*}
Here, $Q_I$, $Q_A$ and $Q_T$ are precision matrices discussed above.\\

\noindent Gaussian priors were assigned to each of the intercepts, $\alpha, \;\hat{\alpha}, \;\bar{\alpha} \sim N(0, 5^2)$. Exponential priors were placed on standard deviations, $\sigma_{(\cdot)} = \sqrt{\tau^{-1}_{(\cdot)}} \sim \text{Exp}(1)$. Gaussian priors were set for all correlation parameters on the logit scale, such that 
\begin{align*} 
  \hat{\rho}_{(\cdot)} = \frac{2}{1 + \exp(-\rho_{(\cdot)})} - 1 \sim N(3, 1^2)
\end{align*}
corresponding to 95\% CI prior weight that the autocorrelation parameters are between 0.48 and 0.99 on the real scale. The proportion of TMICs performed as MMC-Ts, $p_{iat}$, were assigned independent Gaussian distributions on the logit scale, 
\begin{equation*} 
  	\text{logit}(p_{iat}) \sim N(\mu_{iat}, \sigma_{iat}^2) 
\end{equation*}
if there is evidence or knowledge of the VMMC programmes to suggest MMC-Ts are taking place with some mean, $\mu_{iat}$, and standard deviation, $\sigma_{iat}$. Otherwise, the proportions of TMICs performed as MMC-Ts are fixed at zero ($p_{iat}$=0).

\subsection{Accounting for survey weights}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The likelihood function consists of the product of the likelihoods for two independent data sources: (1) household survey data on individual male's age at circumcision and circumcision type, and (2) VMMC programme data about the number of circumcisions conducted for HIV prevention in each region.\\

\noindent For the former of these, survey data consists of individual observations of self-reported age at circumcision, date of birth, and circumcision type (medical or traditional) for male survey respondents. Circumcision status observations were right censored if the respondent reported not being circumcised at the time of the survey or left censored if the individual reported being circumcised at the time of survey but did not report their age at circumcision.\\

\noindent Each survey  $s \in S = \{1, 2, \ldots, N_S\}$ consists of sampled individuals $j \in J_s = \{0, 1, 2, \ldots, N_{J_s}\}$ residing in region $i \in I = \{1, 2, \ldots, N_I\}$. Surveyed individuals were followed from their year of birth until their year of circumcision or their year of censoring. For circumcised individuals, the year of circumcision was calculated as the year of birth plus the age at circumcision. It was assumed that no circumcisions occurred after age 59, so for uncircumcised individuals, censoring occurred either in the survey year or when they were 59. Individuals who self-reported they were circumcised but have a missing age at circumcision were included in the analysis through left censoring. \\

\noindent The partial likelihood contribution for each individual is this defined by the following groups:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{TMIC observed}: Individuals in region $i$ reporting they were circumcised through TMI ceremonies aged $a$ at time $t$. The likelihood of this outcome was the probability an individual in region $i$ reported a TMIC at age $a$ and time $t$, $I^{\text{TMIC}}_{iat} = \lambda^{\text{TMIC}}_{iat}\cdot S_{iat}$. 
	\item \textbf{MMC-nT observed}: Individuals in region $i$ reporting they were medically circumcised aged $a$ at time $t$. The likelihood of this outcome was the incidence of MMC-nT in region $i$, at age $a$ and time $t$, $I^{\text{MMC-nT}}_{iat} = \lambda^{\text{MMC-nT}}_{iat}\cdot S_{iat}$. 
	\item \textbf{Right censored}: Individuals in region $i$ who were uncircumcised by age $a$ at time $t$.  The likelihood of this outcome was the probability of remaining uncircumcised in region $i$, at age $a$ and time $t$,$S_{iat}$
	\item \textbf{Left censored}: Individuals in region $i$ reporting a circumcision at an unknown age and time between birth at time $t-a$ and age $a$ at time $t$. The likelihood of this outomce was the probability of being circumcised in region $i$ before age $a$ at time $t$, $(1-S_{iat})$ 
\end{itemize}

\noindent Taken together, the partial likelihood for the survey data may be expressed as 
\begin{eqnarray*}
	L(\boldsymbol{\Theta}) &= \displaystyle\prod_{(i,a,t)} \prod_{s=1}^{N_s} \prod_{j=1}^{J_s}  \underbrace{\left(\lambda^{\text{TMIC}}_{iat}\cdot S_{iat}\right)^{\mathbbm{1}^{\text{TMIC}}_{sjiat}}}_{\text{TMIC observed}} \cdot  \underbrace{ \left(\lambda^{\text{MMC-nT}}_{iat} \cdot S_{iat}\right)^{\mathbbm{1}^\text{MMC-nT}_{sjiat}}}_{\text{MMC-nT observed}} \cdot
	  \underbrace{\left(S_{iat}\right)^{\mathbbm{1}^{RC}_{sjiat}}}_{\text{Right censored}} \cdot \underbrace{\left(1-S_{iat}\right)^{\mathbbm{1}^{LC}_{sjiat}}}_{\text{Left censored}} \\
	   &= \displaystyle\prod_{(i,a,t)} \left(S_{iat}\lambda^{\text{TMIC}}_{iat}\right)^{\text{N}^{\text{TMIC}}_{iat}} \cdot \left(S_{iat}\lambda^{\text{MMC-nT}}_{iat}\right)^{\text{N}^\text{MMC-nT}_{iat}} \cdot
       \left(S_{iat}\right)^{\text{N}^{RC}_{iat}} \cdot \left(1-S_{iat}\right)^{\text{N}^{LC}_{iat}}
\end{eqnarray*}
where $\mathbbm{1}^{l}_{sjiat}$ is an indicator variable indicating whether individual $j$ in survey $s$ and region $i$ reported outcome $l$ at age $a$ and time $t$. Here, $\text{N}^{l}_{sjiat}$ denoting the total number of individuals reporting outcome $l$ in region $i$ at age $a$ and time $t$
\begin{equation*}
	\text{N}^{l}_{iat} = \sum_{s=1}^{N_s}\sum_{j=1}^{J_s} \mathbbm{1}^k_{sjiat}
\end{equation*}
where $l$ is TMIC, MMC-nT, RC or LC.\\

\noindent Survey data are often collected through a complex two-stage cluster sampling design with unequal sampling probabilities. As a result, performing model inference using a standard likelihood may lead to biased estimates. To account for these survey designs, the probabilities of circumcision were estimated using a weighted pseudo-likelihood in which we replaced the observed counts $\text{N}^l_{iat}$ with weighted counts $\tilde{\text{N}}^l_{iat}$, calculated using survey weights. Each individual $j$ in survey $s$ residing in region $i$ had sampling weight $\omega_{sji}$ which were normalised using the Kish effective sample size, 
\begin{equation*}
	\tilde\omega_{sji} = \frac{\omega_{sji}}{\bar{\omega}_{si}}\cdot \frac{M_s}{M^{\text{eff}}_s} 
\end{equation*}
Here, $\bar{\omega}_{si}$ is the arithmetic mean of all survey weights from the individuals sampled in survey $s$ and region $i$ and $M_s$ is the total sample size in survey $s$ and $M^{\text{eff}}_s$ is the Kish effective sample size which accounts for heterogeneity in sampling weights and is calculated using 
\begin{equation*}
	M^{\text{eff}}_s = \frac{(\sum_j \omega_{sji})^2}{\sum_j \omega_{sji}^{2}}.
\end{equation*}
Using the normalised sampling weights, $\tilde\omega_{sji}$, we calculate the weighted counts, $\tilde{\text{N}}^l_{iat}$, for each region, age and time stratum using 
\begin{equation*}
	\tilde{\text{N}}^{l}_{iat} = \sum_{s=1}^{N_S}\sum_{j=1}^{N_{J_s}}\tilde\omega_{sji} \mathbbm{1}^{\text{l}}_{sjiat}.
\end{equation*}
where $l$ is either TMIC, MMC-nT, RC or LC.

\subsection{Inference}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Models were implemented and fitted in R \cite{rcore} using Template Model Builder (TMB) \cite{kristensen2016tmb}. TMB is a software package that enables users to flexibly fit latent process/variable models to data. It uses automatic differentiation and Laplace approximations to estimate posterior distributions for model parameters. Models were optimised using the quasi-newton L-BFGS-B optimisation method \cite{byrd1995limited}.\\

\noindent Predictions of the district-age-time probabilities of circumcision and other quantities of interest were estimated using Monte Carlo sampling, drawn from the joint posterior distribution, conditional on the optimised hyper-parameters \cite{eaton2021naomi}. Marginal predictive distributions of any quantity of interest, for example, circumcision coverage aggregated to any geographical unit and/or age groups can then be made by summarising the joint samples generated.

\subsection{Survey data}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Data from five nationally representative household surveys that asked men about their circumcision status conducted in South Africa between 2002 and 2017 were included in the analysis: South African National HIV Prevalence, HIV Incidence, Behaviour and Communication Survey (SABSSM) from 2002, 2008, 2012 and 2017 and the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) from 2016. Information related to age, residence, self-reported circumcision status, age at circumcision, who performed the circumcision and where the circumcision took place were extracted for a total 51,261 male respondents across all surveys. Table \ref{tab::survquestions} shows the availability of the questions related to circumcision.\\

\noindent Circumcisions were classed as either medical male circumcision for non-traditional reasons (MMC-nT) or circumcisions conducted in traditional male initiation ceremonies (TMIC) by using responses to both `Who performed the circumcision?' and `Where did the circumcision take place?' were classified as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Circumcisions that took place in a hospital or a clinic \textbf{\textit{and}} were performed by a doctor, nurse or a healthcare worker were classified as MMC-nT.
	\item Circumcisions that took place at home, in a circumcision camp, in an initiation school, in the mountain or in the bush \textbf{\textit{and}} were performed by spiritual leaders, religious leaders or a traditional circumciser were classified as TMIC.
	\item Circumcisions that took place at home, in a circumcision camp, in an initiation school, in the mountain or in the bush \textbf{\textit{and}} were performed by doctors, nurses or a healthcare workers were classified as MMC-nT conducted as part of traditional male initiation (TMI) ceremonies.
	\item Circumcisions that took place in a hospital or a clinic \textbf{\textit{and}} were performed by spiritual leaders, religious leaders or a traditional circumciser were classified as MMC-nT.
\end{itemize}

Individuals only with responses to `Who performed the circumcision?' were classified as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Circumcisions performed by a doctor, nurse or a healthcare worker were classified as MMC-nT
	\item Circumcisions performed by spiritual leaders, religious leaders or a traditional circumciser were classified as TMIC	
\end{itemize}
Individuals only with responses to `Where did the circumcision take place?' were classified as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Circumcisions that took place in a hospital or a clinic were classified as MMC-nT
	\item Circumcisions that took place at home, in a circumcision camp, in an initiation school, in the mountain or in the bush were classified as TMIC	
\end{itemize}
Individuals without responses to either question were excluded from the analysis. Table \ref{tab::MCclassification} summarises the full criteria.

\subsection{Programme data}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent The primary source of information on the reported number of VMMCs performed in South Africa between 2010-2020 was obtained South Africa NDoH District Health Information System (DHIS) and supplemented with data from DMPPT2 and Datim. DHIS contains the number of VMMCs performed in each district in South Africa, reported on a monthly basis from March 2012 (for districts in KwaZulu-Natal), or April 2013 (for all other districts) through to October 2020. VMMCs were reported as ages 10+ until March 2017, and were reported for ages 10-14 and 15+ thereafter. DMPPT2 contains the number of VMMCs performed, reported annually (in South Africa financial years, April-March) between 2010 and 2017 in 5 year age groups (10-14, 15-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49, 50-54 and 55-59). Datim contains the number of VMMCs performed by PEPFAR partners in 28 PEPFAR supported districts in South Africa, reported quarterly between April 2015 and October 2020. VMMCs were reported as ages 10-14, 15-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49 and 50+, with ages 25-49, 30-49 and 40-49 used for some years. Figures A.1-3 show the number of circumcisions reported by DHIS, DMPPT2 and Datim respectively.  \\

\noindent The number of VMMCs performed were aggregated to produce a number for men aged 10+ in each district for each financial year in South Africa, with data used from DMPPT2 for 2010-2012 and from DHIS for 2013-2017. For 2018 onwards, the number of VMMCs performed were estimated by combining data from DHIS and Datim. This is due large number of MMCs performed in a traditional setting in Xhosa men reported to PEPFAR in five Eastern Cape (EC) PEPFAR districts (Buffalo City, Amathole, Chris Hani, Alfred Nzo and Oliver Tambo) which were not reported to DHIS. An initial annual number of VMMCs performed for men aged 10+ for all districts, excluding the five EC PEPFAR districts, were extracted from DHIS.The number of VMMCs provided by PEPFAR in the five EC districts were then pooled and re-allocated to all districts in South Africa, according to the proportion of Xhosa men in each district. The total number of VMMCs performed in each district by data source can be seen in Supplementary Material Figure A.4.  \\
